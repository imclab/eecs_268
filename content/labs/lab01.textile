h1. Lab 01

h2. Doxygen

p((. *Read Appendix F*

Also some information over required comments in the helpful notes section of my website.

h3. Required comments

From the class text book, pages 44 - 45

Commenting required in each source code file:

1. Initial comment at the *top of each file* 

* File name (@file)
* Statement of purpose
* Author (@author)
* Date (@date)
* File version number (@version) -- optional

2. Comment for each *class* 

* Name of class and its header file (@class) -- optional
* Statement of purpose

3. Comment for each *method or function*

* Statement of purpose
* Description of each argument in the argument list (@param)
* Preconditions (@pre)
* Postconditions (@post)
* Exceptions thrown (@throw)
* Return value (@return)

4. Comments in the body of each function elaborating on important / difficult logic

h2. typedef

Format of a typedef statement:
<code>
  typedef DataType AliasName
  
</code>

@DataType@ can be any of the built-in data types in C++. So for example, it could be *integer* or *double*.

@AliasName@ is what you want the new name to be.

h3. typedef examples

<pre>
  <code>
    typedef double LargeNumber;
        //here LargeNumber can now be used to declare a variable of type double.
        
    typedef double* PointerDouble;
        //now PointerDouble can be used to declare a pointer to a double.
        
    typedef int IntArray[15];
        //IntArray now can be used to create an array of integers of size fifteen.
        
    typedef double LargeNumber;
        //here LargeNumber could now be used to declare a variable of type double.
    
    typedef double* PointerDouble;
        //now PointerDouble can be used to declare a pointer to a double.
        
    typedef int IntArray[15];
        //IntArray now can be used to create an array of integers of size fifteen.
  </code>
</pre>

Note the format of the typedef calls matches normal variable declaration.  That is to say, without the @typedef@ component each of these examples would create variables of the @DataType@ type.  However, instead of variable creation, with the @typedef@ statement, new types are created instead.  These new types can then be used as the prefix to the declaration of new variables.

h2. Other Notes

* "Review ostream":http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/iostream/ostream/
** Look at formatting options when outputting numbers.
* Input file to read from should be passed in as a *command line argument*.
